= Snowflake

A spike of the snowflake specification.

A snowflake fits in a signed 64-bit integer (63 bits)

* 41 bit timestamp in seconds since some configured epoch
* 10 bit instance/shard/worker ID
* 12 bit sequence number per worker per timestamp

The implementation of bit-packing is currently wrong.

== Configuration

The Snowflake `Generator` requires an epoch and an instance ID to work.

== Examples

There's one basic example at the moment. Run it with the following command.

```shell
go run examples/checkSequence.go
```

== To do

- Handle JSON representation. See [this article](https://developer.twitter.com/ja/docs/basics/twitter-ids).
